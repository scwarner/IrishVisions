				<h2>Eire Adventures</h2>
				<p>In June 2016, a longtime dream of mine came true: I took a journey to Ireland. My husband, brother, nephew and I spent eight days exploring the country. We stayed in Dublin, Cork and Galway, with visits to Connemara, the Cliffs of Moher, Kinsale and Enniscorthy, ancestral home of my paternal grandfather. Here is a pictorial travelogue of the many fascinating sites we encountered on our visit.</p>
