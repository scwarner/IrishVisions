				<h2>Galway and Western Ireland</h2>
				<p>Galway was our entr√©e into Western Ireland, a beautiful, rugged part of the country. The city has many charms, not the least of which is Galway Bay and its long history of seafaring life. Using Galway as our home base, we traveled to Connemara to see Kylemore Abbey and to the Cliffs of Moher in County Clare.</p>
