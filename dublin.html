				<h2>Dublin</h2>
				<p>Ireland’s bustling capital city has something for everyone – amazing museums and historical sites, beautiful parks, plenty of charming pubs and traditional music venues. And, of course, the Guinness Storehouse. The highlight of our time in the city was a bike tour. Our trusty guide, Brian, took us on a fascinating ride that covered just about everything, from the city’s beginnings as a Viking settlement to the port of Dublin, where Facebook and Google have their Irish headquarters. (With a stop for a pint in between, of course!)</p>

				<figure><a href="images/Dublin2.JPG"><img src="images/Dublin2.JPG" alt="Author and her husband at the Guinness Storehouse"></a><figcaption>The Guinness Storehouse is a popular tourist stop that details every aspect of the brewing and distributions process, as well as the brewer’s historical significance in the city.  If visitors prefer, they can skim over that information and head straight to the Gravity Bar for their free pint.</figcaption></figure>
				<figure><a href="images/Dublin4.JPG"><img src="images/Dublin4.JPG" alt="The Ha'penny Bridge crosses the River Liffey"></a><figcaption>Ha’penny Bridge, one of Dublin’s most famous landmarks, spans the River Liffey to connect the northern and southern sections of the city. As you might guess, the cost of crossing was once a half penny, which was seen as a way of keeping those who lived north of the river out of South Dublin.</figcaption></figure>
				<figure><a href="images/Dublin5.JPG"><img src="images/Dublin5.JPG" alt="The scantily clad Molly Malone is a top attraction"></a><figcaption>The statue of Molly Malone, aka The Tart with the Cart, is a symbol of the city, even though there’s some question about whether such a woman ever existed. She’s a popular tourist attraction, particularly with the fellas.</figcaption></figure>
				<figure><a href="images/Dublin7.jpg"><img src="images/Dublin7.jpg" alt="Image of cells at Dublin's Kilmainham Gaol Museum."></a><figcaption>Kilmainham Gaol Museum offers a sober lesson about Ireland’s long history of rebellion and occupation. It was especially poignant to visit during the centennial year of the 1916 Easter Rebellion, when many rebels lost their lives at the gaol.</figcaption></figure>
				<figure><a href="images/Dublin8.JPG"><img src="images/Dublin8.JPG" alt="A visit to the James Joyce Centre in Dublin is a must for book lovers."></a><figcaption>As a lover of James Joyce’s <em>Dubliners</em>, a visit to the James Joyce Centre was a priority. Haven’t read it? Be sure to give it a try. You’ll be hard-pressed to find better writing. The center’s walking tour took us to spots that inspired scenes from <em>Dubliners</em> and <em>Ulysses</em>, Joyce’s masterpiece.</figcaption></figure>
				<figure><a href="images/Dublin9.jpg"><img src="images/Dublin9.jpg" alt="Author visiting St. Stephen's Green in Dublin."></a><figcaption>When you need a break from city life in Dublin, you can check out the serene St. Stephen’s Green, set right in the heart of the city. Or else visit nearby Merrion Square, where you can say hello to the statue of the great Irish poet-playwright Oscar Wilde.</figcaption></figure>
