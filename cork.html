				<h2>Cork and Other Points South</h2>
				<p>Cork is a charming college town with a bohemian spirit. If I happened to find myself looking for property in Ireland, it would be in this southern city. From the friendly atmosphere of the Oval Bar to the thriving traditional music scene at Sin E, Cork is a lively city set in a gorgeous part of the country.</p>
