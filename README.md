# IrishVisions

This is a website I built after taking the first few courses in Coursera's [Web Design for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/web-design). It is the first website I built on my own. It serves as a pictorial travelogue of a trip to Ireland I took with my husband, brother and nephew in June 2016.

The site uses HTML and CSS, with media queries to make it responsive on mobile, tablet and desktop devices.
